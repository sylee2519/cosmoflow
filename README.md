# Fault-tolerant HVAC Performance Testing Experiments

This document outlines the experimental setup designed to evaluate the performance and fault tolerance of two versions of the HVAC system (ver1 and ver2) using Horovod with Elastic Run on a distributed GPU cluster. The experiments are divided into three main categories: baseline performance without node failure, performance under single node failure at various epochs, and performance under multiple node failures at specific epochs.

## Experiment 1: Baseline Performance Without Node Failure

**Objective:** Measure the baseline performance of the HVAC system (both ver1 and ver2) without any node failures over a fixed number of epochs.

**Setup:**
- **Nodes:** 1024
- **Tasks:** 1024
- **Epochs:** 20
- **HVAC Versions:** Original(without HVAC), ver1, and ver2

**Procedure:**

0. Generate a hostfile to be used with horovodrun and srun.

### Without HVAC
1. Run the training script (`train2.py`) with 1024 tasks for 20 epochs using Horovod with Elastic Run and Gloo backend, and log the output.

## Ver1 && Ver2
1. Launch HVAC server (ver1) on 1024 nodes.

2. Run the training script (`train2.py`) with 1024 tasks for 20 epochs using Horovod with Elastic Run and Gloo backend, and log the output.

3. Repeat steps 1-2 for HVAC server (ver2).

## Experiment 2: Single Node Failure at Various Epochs

**Objective:** Evaluate the performance and recovery of the HVAC system (both ver1 and ver2) under a single node failure at different epochs.

**Setup:**
- **Nodes:** 1024
- **Tasks:** 1024
- **Epochs:** 20
- **HVAC Versions:** ver1 and ver2
- **Kill Times:** 1

**Epochs to Kill:**
- Epoch 3
- Epoch 8
- Epoch 13
- Epoch 18

**Procedure:**

0. Generate a hostfile to be used with horovodrun and srun.

1. For each epoch to kill, repeat the following steps.
    - Version 1
    - Version 2

## Experiment 3: Multiple Node Failures at Specific Epochs

**Objective:** Evaluate the performance and recovery of the HVAC system (both ver1 and ver2) under multiple node failures at specific epochs.

**Setup:**
- **Nodes:** 1024 and 64
- **Tasks:** 1024 and 64
- **Epochs:** 20
- **HVAC Versions:** ver1 and ver2

**Kill Times and Epochs:**
- 1 Kill at Epoch 8
- 2 Kills at Epochs 8 and 10
- 3 Kills at Epochs 8, 10, and 12
- 4 Kills at Epochs 8, 10, 12, and 14
- 5 Kills at Epochs 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16

**Procedure:**

0. Generate a hostfile to be used with horovodrun and srun.

1. For each set of kill times and epochs, repeat the following steps:
    - Version 1 (1024 nodes)
    - Version 2 (1024 nodes)

2. Repeat the above steps for 64 nodes.

## Requirements

1. In `kill.sh` file, modify this line to your scratch directory:
    ```sh
    cd /scratch/s5104a21 # Modify this to your scratch dir
    ```
2. Add the following code snippet in the experiment scripts to copy the log directory to a safe location and clear the BB (Burst Buffer):
    ```sh
	### COPY LOGDIR INTO THE SAFE PLACE && EMPTY THE BB ###
    ```
